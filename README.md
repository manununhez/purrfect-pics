# PurrfectPics

PurrfectPics is your ultimate companion for discovering, customizing, and sharing adorable cat
images on Android. With a wide range of features, PurrfectPics brings joy to every cat lover's
heart.

## Features

- **Discover:** Explore a vast collection of random cat images sourced from the web.
- **Share:** Share delightful cat images with friends, family, and fellow cat enthusiasts with just
  a tap.
- **Save Favorites:** (Coming soon) Save your favorite cat images to easily revisit them later and
  create your personalized collection.
- **Splash Screen:** Engage users with a captivating splash screen animation while the app loads. (
  Note: There is a known issue with the splash screen not showing on Android 12. A temporary
  solution is to **open the app from the app tray**, as
  indicated [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69812590/android-12-splash-screen-icon-not-displaying))

## Considerations

- FREE Cat APIs used in this version: [Cataas](https://cataas.com/)
  and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). In particular, Pexels API
  is [rate-limited](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#guidelines), in case of errors for
  this, a new API key will be necessary to be generated.
- Not persisted in DB or preferences because this API has dynamic and frequently updated data. On
  the other hand, Coil image lib does use disk and memory cache to smooth image loading.
- KtfmtFormat plugin applied for code formatting.
